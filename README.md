# fastapi-faust

FastAPI + Faust = :heart:
ASGI fastapi integration with Python Stream Processing. A Faust fork with FastAPI integration.

## Basic Architecture
moved to confluence

## Running the app locally
This is a very opinionated example repository for a python backend API. It is not a template as it contains a few things already as an example for how to build something from here.
This project was originally created by grillazz, this is a hard fork as I intend to deviate from the upstream - adding more opinion and changing a few things.
